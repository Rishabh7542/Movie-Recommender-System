# Movie-Recommender-System
This is a repository containing files of my web-application which recommends movie based on the user input of a movie name.

This web application uses content based recommendation algorithm based on cosine similarity.

In the app.py file, unique api key is used which is given to every account made in TMDB (for database of movies and their information).

similarity.pkl file is too large to be uploaded on git-hub even after compressing.
